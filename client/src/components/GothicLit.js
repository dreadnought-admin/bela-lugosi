      <h1><em>What is Gothic Literature?</em></h1>
      <div>
        <p>Gothic fiction, sometimes called Gothic horror in the 20th century, is a loose literary aesthetic of fear and haunting. The name is a reference to Gothic architecture of the European Middle Ages, 
            which was characteristic of the settings of early Gothic novels.
            The first work to call itself Gothic was Horace Walpole's 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto, 
            later subtitled "A Gothic Story". Subsequent 18th century contributors included Clara Reeve, Ann Radcliffe,
            William Thomas Beckford, and Matthew Lewis. The Gothic influence continued into the early 19th century, works by the 
            Romantic poets, and novelists such as Mary Shelley, Charles Maturin, Walter Scott and E. T. A. Hoffmann frequently drew upon 
            gothic motifs in their works.
            The early Victorian period continued the use of gothic, in novels by Charles Dickens and the BrontÃ« sisters, 
            as well as works by the American writers Edgar Allan Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Later prominent works were Dracula by Bram Stoker,
            Richard Marsh's The Beetle and Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Twentieth-century contributors include
            Daphne du Maurier, Stephen King, Shirley Jackson, Anne Rice and Toni Morrison.

            Gothic fiction is characterized by an environment of fear, the threat of 
            supernatural events, and the intrusion of the past upon the present. Gothic fiction is distinguished from other
            forms of scary or supernatural stories, such as fairy tales, by the specific theme of the present being haunted 
            by the past. The setting typically includes physical reminders of the past, especially through ruined buildings which stand as 
            proof of a previously thriving world which is decaying in the present. Especially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, 
            characteristic settings include castles, religious buildings like monasteries and convents, and crypts. 
            The atmosphere is typically claustrophobic, and common plot elements include vengeful persecution, imprisonment, and murder.
            The depiction of horrible events in Gothic fiction often serves as a metaphorical expression of psychological or social conflicts.
            The form of a Gothic story is usually discontinuous and convoluted, often incorporating tales within tales, changing narrators, and
            framing devices such as discovered manuscripts or interpolated histories.Other characteristics, regardless of relevance to the
            main plot, can include sleeplike and deathlike states, live burials, doubles, unnatural echoes or silences, the discovery of obscured 
            family ties, unintelligible writings, and nocturnal landscapes and dreams. Gothic fiction 
            often moves between "high culture" and "low" or "popular culture".
